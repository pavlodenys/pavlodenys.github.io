# Fractal View

Fractal View is a web application designed for visualizing fractals such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. It offers an interactive interface, allowing users to explore these intricate mathematical structures with adjustable parameters and zoom functionality.

## Overview

Fractal View is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the D3.js library for handling dynamic and interactive data visualizations. The project consists of two main files: `index.html` and `fractal.js`.

### Architecture and Technologies

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the web application.
- **CSS**: Styles the application for a user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the fractal generation and interactive features.
- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations.

### Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main entry point of the web application. It sets up the HTML structure, including the canvas for rendering fractals and the control panel for user interaction.
- **`fractal.js`**: Handles the fractal generation logic, user interactions, and rendering on the canvas.

## Features

- **Fractal Formulas**: Choose between Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Set the maximum number of iterations for fractal generation.
- **Zoom Functionality**: Click and drag to zoom into specific areas of the fractal. Buttons for zooming in and out.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd fractal-view
    ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a web browser**:
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start using the application.
